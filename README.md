# C++ Algorithms

This repository documents my progress in **C++ algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming**.  
It contains study notes, solved exercises, and small projects written in modern **C++17/20**.

---

## Structure
- `exercises/` — weekly practice problems
- `projects/` — mini-projects applying algorithms in practice

---

## Goals
- Master modern C++ for algorithms and system-level programming
- Build a portfolio of competitive programming and applied algorithm projects
- Prepare for ICPC-style contests and Quant/Software Engineering interviews
