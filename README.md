# C++ Algorithms

This repository documents my progress in **C++ algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming**.  
It contains study notes, solved exercises, and small projects written in modern **C++17/20**.

---

## Structure
- `notes/` — summaries on advanced C++ topics (STL, smart pointers, templates, multithreading, etc.)
- `exercises/` — weekly practice problems (ICPC/LeetCode/Codeforces style)
- `projects/` — mini-projects applying algorithms in practice

---

## Goals
- Master modern C++ for algorithms and system-level programming
- Build a portfolio of competitive programming and applied algorithm projects
- Prepare for ICPC-style contests and Quant/Software Engineering interviews
