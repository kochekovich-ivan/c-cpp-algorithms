# C/C++ Algorithms

This repository documents my progress in **C/C++ algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming**.  

---

## Structure
- `exercises/` — weekly practice problems
- `projects/` — mini-projects applying algorithms in practice

---

## Goals
- Master modern C/C++ for algorithms and system-level programming
- Build a portfolio of competitive programming and applied algorithm projects
